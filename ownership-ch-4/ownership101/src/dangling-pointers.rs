// In languages with pointers, itâ€™s easy to erroneously create a dangling pointer.
// A dangling pointer references a location in memory that may have been given 
// to someone else, which frees some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory



// To fix the dangler pointer problem, we can simply return the string directly.
