    // Useful notes about arrays and vectors

    // Arrays must have the same type and a fixed size
    // Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap 
    // or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements. 
    // An array isnâ€™t as flexible as the vector type, though. 
    // A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow or shrink in size. 
    // If youâ€™re unsure whether to use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a vector.
