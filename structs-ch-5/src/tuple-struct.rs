    // Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but donâ€™t have names associated with their fields; 
    // rather, they just have the types of the fields. 
    
    // Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple a different type from other tuples, 
    // and when naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.

    // tuple struct instances behave like tuples: you can destructure them into their individual pieces, 
    // you can use a . followed by the index to access an individual value, and so on.
