// Structs let you create custom types that are meaningful for your domain. 
// By using structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other and name each piece to make your code clear. 
// In impl blocks, you can define functions that are associated with your type, and methods are a kind of associated function that let you specify the behavior that instances of your structs have.
